org-present-remote adds a simple, mobile-friendly web remote control
for moving between slides in [[https://github.com/rlister/org-present][org-present]].

** usage

To start it, first enter presentation mode with ~M-x org-present~,
then do ~M-x org-present-remote--remote-on~.

You will need to enter the host to which to make the interface
available on.  For local testing this can be ~localhost~.  For actual
use you will need to supply your machine's IP address.

Then use a browser to open the remote control by browsing to port 8009
on the host you supplied, e.g.:

[[http://localhost:8009/][http://localhost:8009]]

** faq
*** how do I determine my IP address?
On many *NIX systems you can do this with ifconfig.  For example, to
determine the IP address of your WiFi adaptor on FreeBSD:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ ifconfig wlan0
wlan0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> metric 0 mtu 1500
  ether 24:77:03:29:94:cc
  hwaddr 24:77:03:29:94:cc
  inet 192.168.43.81 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.43.255
  nd6 options=29<PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL>
  media: IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet MCS mode 11ng
  status: associated

  scanvalid 60 protmode CTS ampdulimit 64k ampdudensity 4
  -amsdutx amsdurx shortgi -stbc wme roaming MANUAL
  groups: wlan
#+END_SRC

From this you can see that your IP address is 192.168.43.81.
